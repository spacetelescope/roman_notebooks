# Installing Extra Software
As part of the science platform, STScI provides pre-installed software. You can also install your own software.

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">note:</span> Any commands given on this page must be entered into a terminal window. To open a new terminal window, select <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">file > new terminal</span> from the menu bar.

## What software is pre-installed?
To get a full list of pre-installed software, run `conda list`. Since this full list is often quite long, you can check the version for a particular package using `conda list <package>`. For example, `conda list astropy` or `conda list numpy`.

If there is a package that you think should be included by default, you can submit a request to the [Roman help desk](https://stsci.service-now.com/roman).

## How do I install and manage my own software?
It is essential to create software environments when working in a cloud platform. A simple `pip install <package>` will not produce the desired installation. (Instead, it will produce a temporary installation that will be deleted when you next log in.)

As part of the science platform, you can use some helper commands to create and manage new software environments. Follow the steps below to create your own environments and install packages.

### 0. Listing Environments

To list environments, including those you've installed manually, run `kernel-list`.

### 1. Creating a Conda Environment

First, you should use the `kernel-create` command to generate an environment for your software. You can select your desired Python version, and choose a name for the environment.

`kernel-create <environment-name> [<python-version>] [<lab-display-name>]`

Note that "environment name" is used in terminal commands, while "lab-display-name" is what appears when you select a Notebook kernel. For example, to create a Python 3.12 environment that will appear as "TESS Lightcurves" in Jupyter:

`kernel-create tess-lc 3.12 "TESS Lightcurves"`

Alternatively, `[python-version]` can be replaced with the path to a YAML file. The YAML file will then be used to build the environment. See step 4 to learn how to export a YAML file from an existing environment.

Now that we've created the base environment, we can proceed to the next step.

### 2. Activating an Environment

To install software, we must activate the environment. Note that we need to use the environment name, not the display name. Following the above example, this would be:

`source kernel-activate tess-lc`

With the kernel activated, you can now install software.

### 3. Installing Software

In an activated kernel, you can use pip as you would normally. For example:

`pip install lightkurve`

### 4. Exporting an Environment
To export an environment for later use (e.g. modifying the default installation), use the `kernel-export` command:

`kernel-export <environment-name> <output-file-name.yaml>`

Following our running example, a valid command would be:

`kernel-export tess-lc tess-lc-specs.yaml`

To create an environment using this yaml file, replace the python version in step 2 with a path to the yaml file.


### 5. Deleting an Environment

To remove an environment you no longer want, use the `kernel-delete` command, e.g.:

`kernel-delete tess-lc`


### Other Notes
#### I want to use venv!
This is supported. Simply swap the command in step 1 for `kernel-create-venv`, and you'll get a [Python Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) instead.
