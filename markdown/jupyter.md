# Working in JupyterLab

When you launch a server in the Nexus, you are placed in a JupyterLab session. JupyterLab is the workspace where you can open notebooks, browse files, run code, use terminals, and access Roman tools directly in your browser.

If you are new to JupyterLab, the **Welcome Tour** provides a helpful orientation. It appears automatically the first time you log in, and you can reopen it anytime from the **Help menu**.

To create a new notebook, open a new tab. This will show the **Launcher** (see figure below), a panel where you can start notebooks, terminals, text files, and other tools available in your selected image.

When you open a notebook for the first time, you may also see the **Notebook Tour**, which introduces the basic features of notebook editing and execution.

For more details on the interface, see the official [JupyterLab documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Common Actions in JupyterLab
- **Open or edit files** by clicking them in the left sidebar.
- **Create a new notebook** by opening a new tab and selecting **Notebook** from the Launcher.
- **Run code** in a notebook cell using **Shift + Enter**.
- **Restart the kernel** (the Python process running your code) using the circular arrow button in the top toolbar if needed.
- **Open a terminal** from the Launcher to run command-line tools or manage files.
- **Save your work** in your home or team directories — all files in these locations persist across sessions.
