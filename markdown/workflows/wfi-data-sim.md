# RRN Science Workflows: WFI Data Simulations

This science workflow guides the user through the simulation, processing, manipulation, and visualization of WFI imaging data products.


## Workflow
- [Roman-I-Sim](../../content/notebooks/romanisim/romanisim.ipynb): Simulate Roman WFI Raw Data and Exposure Level Products
> Simulate raw data (L1) and exposure level images (L2) for your field using Roman-I-Sim, a Galsim-based simulator designed for WFI imaging data. Roman-I-Sim leverages [Galsim](https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim) to render astronomical scenes, [WebbPSF](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/simulation-tools-handbook-home/webbpsf-for-roman) to model the point spread function, and [CRDS](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/accessing-wfi-data/crds-for-reference-files) to access the necessary calibration information for producing realistic WFI images. You can simulate L1 and L2 data using either synthetic catalogs or the GAIA catalog. Roman-I-Sim generates outputs in the standard [Roman ASDF format](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/wfi-data-format/introduction-to-asdf). To learn more about this SOC-developed and maintained software, consult [Roman-I-Sim on ReadTheDocs](https://romanisim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- [Working with ASDF](../../content/notebooks/working_with_asdf/working_with_asdf.ipynb): Explore Roman WFI Data Files
> Explore your WFI data products by understanding the [Advanced Scientific Data Format (ASDF)](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/wfi-data-format/introduction-to-asdf). Roman WFI data products, including those generated by [Roman-I-Sim](https://romanisim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), are saved in ASDF format. Learn how to manage ASDF files, read metadata, and access the data arrays. To learn more, visit the [RDox pages on Roman WFI data levels and products](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/wfi-data-format/data-levels-and-products).
- [Exposure Pipeline](../../content/notebooks/exposure_pipeline/exposure_pipeline.ipynb): Process Roman WFI Raw Data to Obtain Exposure Level Images
> Use RomanCal, the Roman calibration pipeline, to process raw (L1) data simulated with [Roman-I-Sim](https://romanisim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) into exposure level products (L2). The exposure level pipeline contains the algorithms necessary to correct raw WFI data for instrumental effects, and
collapse the data along the time axis into rate images suitable for scientific analysis. To learn more about the overall exposure level pipeline and its different steps visit the [RDox documentation](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/roman-stsci-data-pipelines/exposure-level-pipeline).
- [Data Visualization](../../content/notebooks/data_visualization/data_visualization.ipynb): Visualize Roman WFI Exposure Level Products
> Visualize your L2 exposure level products using Matplotlib and Imviz, a tool for visualizing and quickly analyzing 2D astronomical images. Imviz is based on the Jupyter platform and includes built-in Astropy functionality. For additional background information, consult [Imviz documentation on ReadTheDocs](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/imviz/index.html).
- [Mosaic Pipeline](../../content/notebooks/mosaic_pipeline/mosaic_pipeline.ipynb): Process Roman WFI Exposure Level Products into Mosaic Images
> Use RomanCal, the Roman calibration pipeline, to process exposure level (L2) products into mosaic (L3) images. The mosaic pipeline is responsible for combining individual detector exposures into mosaics made up of multiple exposures. In this context, mosaic indicates a combination or stack of multiple exposures into a larger or deeper image. To learn more about the overall mosaic level pipeline and its different steps visit the [RDox documentation](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/roman-stsci-data-pipelines/mosaic-level-pipeline).

## Caveats and limitations
While the current content focuses on the WFI imaging mode, more content on the WFI spectroscopic mode will be available by Summer 2025.
