# RRN Science Workflows: WFI Data Analysis 

This science workflow guides users through the discovery and access of data while working in the cloud, as well as the visualization and analysis of Roman WFI data products. While the current workflow focuses primarily on simulated imaging data, it includes an introductory spectroscopic example and a ground-test analysis use case.

## Workflow Description

- [**Data Discovery and Access**](../../notebooks/data_discovery_and_access/data_discovery_and_access.ipynb)

  Retrieve WFI simulated images from the cloud or access data from active missions (e.g. Hubble, TESS, and JWST) from MAST. Data are streamed directly into memory, removing the need for local downloads. Users can access datasets hosted by [STScI MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/) or simulated Roman WFI data stored in the Nexus environment. To learn more, visit the [RDox pages on accessing Roman WFI data](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/accessing-wfi-data).
  
- [**Working with ASDF**](../../notebooks/working_with_asdf/working_with_asdf.ipynb)

  Explore Roman WFI data products stored in the [Advanced Scientific Data Format (ASDF)](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/wfi-data-format/introduction-to-asdf), including files generated by [Roman-I-Sim](https://romanisim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This step covers inspecting metadata, understanding data structure, and accessing image arrays. To learn more, visit the [RDox pages on Roman WFI data levels and products](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/wfi-data-format/data-levels-and-products)

- [**Data Visualization**](../../notebooks/data_visualization/data_visualization.ipynb)

  Visualize Roman WFI exposure-level products using tools such as Matplotlib and Imviz to inspect image quality and explore basic features of the data. Imviz is based on the Jupyter platform and includes built-in Astropy functionality. For additional background information, consult [Imviz documentation on ReadTheDocs](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/imviz/index.html).
  
- **Analyze Roman WFI images**:
  Perform example analysis tasks on WFI images, including:
  * [**Aperture photometry**](../../notebooks/aperture_photometry/aperture_photometry.ipynb): Measure integrated fluxes using forced aperture photometry on simulated WFI images.
  * [**Galaxy Shapes**](../../notebooks/measuring_galaxy_shapes/measuring_galaxy_shapes.ipynb): Perform basic galaxy shape measurements on simulated WFI images.
  * [**Roman cutouts**](../../notebooks/roman_cutouts/roman_cutouts.ipynb): Use the [Astrocut service](https://astrocut.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#http://) to generate image cutouts from larger WFI images for focused analysis.
  * [**Grism Spectral Extraction**](../../notebooks/grism_spectral_extraction/grism_spectral_extraction.ipynb): Extract one-dimensional spectra from simulated Roman WFI slitless grism images.
- [**WFI TVAC Bright Star Test Data (Early Access)**](../../notebooks/ground_test_analysis/wfi_tvac_brightstar.ipynb)
  
  An additional analysis-level tutorial demonstrates exploratory analysis of WFI Bright Star Saturation test data obtained during the WFI thermal vacuum (TVAC) campaign. This notebook shows how to process a subset of Level 1 ground-test data using [RomanCal](https://github.com/spacetelescope/romancal) and examine saturation behavior and frame-level effects near bright sources.
  
    This tutorial serves as a **placeholder** for a more comprehensive TVAC-focused workflow. A complete WFI TVAC science workflow, integrating additional ground-test datasets and analysis steps, is currently in development and will be released in a future update

## Caveat and limitations
While the current workflow primarily focuses on WFI imaging investigations, it includes an introductory spectroscopic example and a ground-test analysis use case. Expanded spectroscopic and TVAC-focused content will be added in future releases.
