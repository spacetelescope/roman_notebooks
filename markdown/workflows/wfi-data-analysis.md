# RRN Science Workflows: WFI Data Analysis 

This science workflow guides users through the discovery and access of data while working in the cloud, as well as the manipulation, visualization, and analysis of simulated Roman WFI imaging data products.

## Workflow Description

- [Data Discovery and Access](../../content/notebooks/data_discovery_and_access/data_discovery_and_access.ipynb): Retrieve WFI simulated images from the cloud or access data from MAST
> Stream data directly into memory from the cloud, eliminating the need to download it locally. Access data from the [STScI MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/) server, which hosts datasets from active missions such as Hubble, TESS, and JWST, or retrieve simulated Roman WFI data stored in the cloud. To learn more about accessing Roman WFI data, visit the [RDox pages](ADD LINK)
- [Working with ASDF](../../content/notebooks/working_with_asdf/working_with_asdf.ipynb): Explore Roman WFI Data Files
> Explore your WFI data products by understanding the [Advanced Scientific Data Format (ASDF)](ADD LINK). Roman WFI data products, including those generated by [Roman-I-Sim](https://romanisim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), are saved in ASDF format. Learn how to manage ASDF files, read metadata, and access the data arrays. To learn more about Roman WFI data levels and products, visit the [RDox pages on the WFI data format](ADD LINK)
- [Data Visualization](../../content/notebooks/data_visualization/data_visualization.ipynb): Visualize Roman WFI Exposure Level Products
> Visualize your L2 exposure level products using Matplotlib and Imviz, a tool for visualizing and quickly analyzing 2D astronomical images. Imviz is based on the Jupyter platform and includes built-in Astropy functionality. For additional background information, consult [Imviz documentation on ReadTheDocs](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/imviz/index.html).
- Analyze Roman WFI images
    - > [Aperture photometry](../../content/notebooks/aperture_photometry/aperture_photometry.ipynb): Perform forced aperture photometry on a WFI image simulated with Roman I-sim. Learn how to measure the integrated fluxes for a set of specified source positions and aperture sizes.
    - > [Galaxy Shapes](../../content/notebooks/measuring_galaxy_shapes/measuring_galaxy_shapes.ipynb): Perform shape measurements of astronomical sources on a WFI image simulated with Roman-I-Sim. Use Galsim to perform ellipticity measurements, and learn how to fit a Sérsic model to a galaxy cutout.
    - > [Roman cutouts](../../content/notebooks/roman_cutouts/roman_cutouts.ipynb): Create cutouts from Roman simulated images using the [Astrocut](https://astrocut.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#http://) service, which offers tools to generate cutouts from large astronomical images.
    - > [Grism Spectral Extraction](../../content/notebooks/grism_spectral_extraction/grism_spectral_extraction.ipynb): Follow a simple workflow to extract 1D grism spectra for individual objects from a simulated Roman WFI 2D dispersed image. Apply both the 'box extraction' method with various box dimensions and the optimal extraction technique to a variety of sources to produce wavelength- and flux-calibrated 1D spectra.

## Caveat and limitations
While the current content focuses on WFI imaging mode, more material on spectroscopic products will be available by Summer 2025.
