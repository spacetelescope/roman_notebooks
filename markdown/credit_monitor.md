# Monitoring Credit Usage
The Nexus provides a built-in **Credit Monitor Dashboard** for tracking compute credit consumption. Credit and account policies can be found on the [Nexus article in RDox](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/roman-research-nexus).

You can launch the dashboard from the **JupyterLab Launcher**.

*Open the Launcher from the JupyterLab menu using **File → New Launcher***.

The dashboard allows you to:
- View daily aggregated credit usage
- Filter results by date range and credit metric
- Export filtered data to a CSV file in your home directory

**Team admins** can also view total team usage and usage broken down by individual team members.

## Using the Dashboard
1. **Open the dashboard** from the Launcher.
2. **Select a user** (admins can choose any team member).
3. **Set a date range** for the period you want to examine.
4. **Choose a credit metric** (e.g., total, CPU, memory, egress, or storage).
5. **Review the plots and summary table**, which update automatically based on your filters.
6. **Export results** using the Export CSV button.
