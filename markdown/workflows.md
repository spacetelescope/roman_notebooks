# Roman Science Workflows
In the Roman Research Nexus (RRN) framework, a **Notebook Tutorial** refers to a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the use of a specific piece of code or tool. A **Science Workflow**, instead, is a combination of multiple Notebook Tutorials, along with accompanying documentation, that guides users through a specific science use case.

Users can run the ["Notebook Tutorials"](./tutorials.md) in any order or modify them to suit specific data or science goals. However, following the sequence outlined in the Science Workflows ensures a complete, end-to-end experience. Science Workflows are particularly beneficial for new users unfamiliar with Roman data, tools, and infrastructure, but they also offer a valuable starting point for experienced users aiming to apply them to their own datasets.

We currently support three Science Workflows focused on the Roman Wide Field Instrument (WFI):
- [WFI Data Simulation](./workflows/wfi-data-sim.md)
- [WFI Data Analysis](./workflows/wfi-data-analysis.md)
- [WFI Observation Planning](./workflows/wfi-obs-plan.md)

There are many potential workflows beyond those listed here. Even if yours is not explicitly mentioned, the RRN can likely support your specific workflow!

Although the current content primarily focuses on WFI imaging mode, more content on spectroscopic products will be available by Summer 2025.
