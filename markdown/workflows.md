# Science Workflows

Science Workflows in the Nexus organize related [Notebook Tutorials](./tutorials.md) into guided, end-to-end examples that show how individual tools and analysis steps connect into a broader scientific task. Each workflow provides a structured path through a specific use case, while the underlying tutorials remain available as standalone examples that users can adapt to their own projects.

Workflows are designed to help users explore Roman-style analysis patterns in the Early Access environment, using the software, data structures, and simulation tools available in the platform image.

## WFI Workflows (Early Access)

The Early Access release currently includes three WFI-focused Science Workflows: 
- [WFI Data Simulation](./workflows/wfi-data-sim.md)
- [WFI Data Analysis](./workflows/wfi-data-analysis.md)
- [WFI Observation Planning](./workflows/wfi-obs-plan.md)

Together, these workflows demonstrate how Roman tools can be used for pipeline-level data simulation, exploratory analysis of simulated WFI products within the Nexus environment, and proposal planning. 

Each workflow highlights a different aspect of the platform ecosystem—from generating synthetic data and processing them through the Roman calibration pipeline to performing basic measurements on exposure-level products and evaluating observing strategies. While the current materials focus on WFI-imaging investigations, they also include an introductory spectroscopic example within the Data Analysis workflow, with additional spectroscopic content planned for future updates. Two further workflows—one covering **time-domain analysis** and another focused on **WFI TVAC data**—are in development and expected to be added in **early 2026**.

## Using Workflows
Workflows are composed of individual [Notebook Tutorials](./tutorials.md), each focused on a specific tool or analysis step. Users may work through an entire workflow sequentially or use the tutorials independently, depending on their goals. If you would like to modify the material for a custom workflow, first copy it into your personal home directory or team home directory.
