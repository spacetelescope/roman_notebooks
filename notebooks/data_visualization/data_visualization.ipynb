    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to visualize and explore Roman WFI image data arrays. We separate this tutorial into two high-level components:\n",
    "1. creating static images with world coordinate system (WCS) overlays; and\n",
    "2. using the Jdaviz tool to interactively explore WFI image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on how to visualize WFI Level 2 (L2; calibrated rate image) data in ASDF format. For WFI, L2 indicates that the data have been processed to flag and/or correct for detector-level effects (e.g., saturation, classic non-linearity, etc.) and the resultants fitted into a count rate image. Each L2 ASDF file contains a single WFI detector, thus a complete WFI exposure is made up of 18 L2 files. For more information WFI L2 files, please see the RDox article on [Data Levels and Products](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/wfi-data-format/data-levels-and-products#DataLevelsandProducts-Level2-CalibratedExposuresLevel2)."

As you can see, when blinking the images in detector coordinates, the extended source is only visible in one image due to dithering between the exposures. Next, we will link the images by their WCS information so that the sources remain fixed in the display. Linking the images by WCS will reset the center and zoom, so let's reapply that as well.\n",

The transformation is only well-defined within a bounding box, and moving outside that bounding box produces unexpected behavior, particularly due to the polynomial terms in the transformation between pixel and sky coordinates. As a result, the current version of Imviz might have some difficulties with setting a position and zooming after linking the images by WCS."
