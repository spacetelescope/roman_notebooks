    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this notebook is to illustrate how to open and handle Roman Wide Field Instrument (WFI) data. WFI data are stored in [Advanced Scientific Data Format (ASDF)](https://asdf-standard.readthedocs.io/) files, which combine human-readable hierarchical metadata structure with binary array data. ASDF files are self-validating using pre-defined schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are tools to interact with ASDF files in Python, Julia, C/C++, and IDL. In this example we focus on the Python interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roman ASDF files can be opened and manipulated using two main approaches: \n",
    "1. using the `roman_datamodels` library, and\n",
    "2. using the `asdf` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `roman_datamodels` offers the advantage of loading different data blocks as `stnode`-based objects, providing access to their methods. In contrast, the `asdf` library loads the data blocks as they were serialized on disk. While this approach loses some of the `roman_datamodels` capabilities, it also provides more flexibility. In this notebook, we illustrate both approaches, starting with loading data via `roman_datamodels`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional information about Roman ASDF files can be found in the [Introduction to ASDF](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/wfi-data-format/introduction-to-asdf) article on RDox."

More information about the Roman coordinate systems can be found in the [PySIAF for Roman](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/simulation-tools-handbook-home/simulation-development-utilities/pysiaf-for-roman) article on RDox. **All** archived L1-4 data products (e.g., WCS transforms, catalogs, etc.) will use the Python 0-indexed system.\n",

The center of the L2 image array in the zero-indexed science coordinate frame is (x, y) = (2043.5, 2043.5) pixels. Note that the 4-pixel reference border was removed during processing, and thus the total L2 image size is 4088 rows x 4088 columns. Since the center of the first pixel in Python is (0, 0) and the array size is even, the center of the detector is (x, y) = (2043.5, 2043.5). Also note that GWCS assumes inputs in the order (x, y) and not the Pythonic form (y, x)."
