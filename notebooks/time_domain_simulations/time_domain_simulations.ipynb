    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore how to create a series of simulations of a variable source using the Roman WFI image simulator Roman I-Sim. We will use a transient source, in this case a Type Ia supernova, for our example, but the methods described here can be extended to any type of variable source for which we have a light curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "A light curve is a representation of the brightness of a source as a function of time. In this tutorial, we will use a Python package (`sncosmo`) to generate a model light curve for us, but there are numerous resources available for model and template light curves for both transient and cyclic variables of various types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulating Transients with Roman I-Sim\n",
    "\n",
    "We have three options when we want to simulate time-domain observations, and while all are equally viable choices, there are some reasons why you may want to choose one over the other. These options are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simulate a Level 1 (L1; uncalibrated ramp cube) file for each observation epoch with a catalog of all (both varying and non-varying) sources unique to each epoch, and calibrate each L1 file to Level 2 (L2; calibrated rate image) using the [Exposure Pipeline](../exposure_pipeline/exposure_pipeline.ipynb).\n",
    "2. Simulate a L1 file for each observation epoch with a catalog of non-varying sources, calibrate each L1 file to L2 using the Exposure Pipeline, and use [Roman I-Sim](../romanisim/romanisim.ipynb) to inject variable sources into each L2 image.\n",
    "3. Simulate a single L1 observation with a catalog of non-varying sources, calibrate it to L2 using the Exposure Pipeline, and use Roman I-Sim to inject variable sources into copies of the L2 image for each observation epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "At present, Roman I-Sim does not support source injection into the L1 file, but this can be accomplished by updating the input source catalog for each observation epoch. This is method 1 above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both methods 1 and 2 result in a large volume of data on disk and significant processing time, but yield the most realistic results, allowing for movement of the sources in the focal plane between observations and different realizations of the noise properties. Method 3 is the most computationally efficient method, but results in images where the sky background and non-varying sources are identical in every image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will adopt method 3, but provide tips for how to implement the other two methods. The [Roman I-Sim](../romanisim/romanisim.ipynb) and [Exposure Pipeline](../exposure_pipeline/exposure_pipeline.ipynb) tutorials provide background information and examples that provide background information for implementing methods 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Catalog Setup (Host Galaxy)\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to begin by making some decisions about the non-variable source catalog. First, we need to know what part of the sky we will be observing, as that helps us to place the sources on the WFI detector(s) that we will simulate. In this example, we put our supernova host galaxy at the center of detector WFI01 with the WFI pointed at (RA, Dec) = (72.5, -30.7) degrees and a WFI position angle of -60 degrees (telescope roll angle of 0 degrees).\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we copy the `PointWFI` class we created and described in the [Roman I-Sim](../romanisim/romanisim.ipynb) tutorial. In this tutorial, we have added another method (`get_detector_coords()`) to the class that returns the RA and Dec for a science pixel position on a detector for a given WFI pointing."
