    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Roman Interactive Sensitivity Tool ([RIST](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/simulation-tools-handbook-home/roman-wfi-exposure-time-calculator/roman-interactive-sensitivity-tool})) is a simulation tool designed to help users quickly explore the feasibility of observations for the Wide Field Instrument (WFI). RIST is a simplified version of the Exposure Time Calculator engine [`Pandeia`](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/simulation-tools-handbook-home/roman-wfi-exposure-time-calculator/pandeia-for-roman) -- it uses a pre-computed grid of exposure time calculations with `Pandeia` that sample a set of exposure parameters and observing setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "RIST provides users an estimate of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based on their selections of source brightness, spectral energy distribution (SED) type, multi-accumulation ([MA](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/roman-instruments-home/wfi-imaging-mode-user-guide/observing-with-the-wfi-in-imaging-mode/wfi-multiaccum-tables)) tables, and backgrounds, while using a single on-axis point source. For the details of the selections, see Notes below. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "RIST depends on a number of modules to run. A comprehensive list of these modules and how they are utilized are listed below:\n",
    "- *NumPy* for numerical computing\n",
    "- *pandas* to read and load the pre-computed *pandeia* grid\n",
    "- *bokeh* for the interactive plotting\n",
    "- *xarray* to provide RIST an N-dimentional array as a structure of the pre-computed *pandeia* grid\n",
    "- *SciPy* to interpolate RIST's *xarray* grid.\n",
    "- *Pandeia* is the Exposure Time Calculator for Roman and is used to compute a grid that samples a set of parameter space. Pandeia uses the following modules:\n",
    "  - *astropy* \n",
    "  - *photutils\n",
    "  - *synphot\n",
    "  - *stsynphot\n"

    "## Notes\n",
    "- RIST assumes a point source target. For extended sources, please use Pandeia for more accurate results.\n",
    "- Among the 18 detectors of WFI, all calculations were done for WFI01. More information on the detectors can be found [here](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/roman-instruments-home/wfi-imaging-mode-user-guide/wfi-design/description-of-wfi).\n",
    "- RIST uses canned backgrounds that are pre-computed using the [Roman Background Tool](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/simulation-tools/simulation-tools/additional-simulation-tools/roman-background-tool) at the locations that are representative of the 3 Core Community Surveys footprints. More information on the canned backgrounds can be found under [Pandeia Engine & Roman Interactive Sensitivity Tool (RIST) ](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/roman-instruments/wfi-imaging-mode-user-guide/observing-with-the-wfi-in-imaging-mode/considerations-of-backgrounds-for-roman-wfi-observations#Pandeia-RIST) section in [Considerations of Backgrounds for Roman WFI Observations](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/roman-instruments/wfi-imaging-mode-user-guide/observing-with-the-wfi-in-imaging-mode/considerations-of-backgrounds-for-roman-wfi-observations) for the details. \n",
    "    - The background is set to the medium level for all locations. \n",
    "- Multi-accumulation (MA) tables describe the sequence of individual reads that are combined into resultants and that comprise the up-the-ramp simplaing during a single exposure of the WFI detectors. The MA tables currently available in RIST are based on the Roman Design Reference Mission, and are thoroughly documented on [RDox](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/raug/astronomers-proposal-tool-apt/appendix/appendix-wfi-multiaccum-tables).\n",
    "    - MA table naming convention: ***obs mode_exp time_# of resultants***. '_s' at the end of the name indicates 'sparse fields only'\n",
    "        - obs mode is either 'im' for the imaging or 'sp' for the spectroscopic mode (currently not supported by RIST), respectively. \n",
    "        - exp time is the effective exposure time in seconds\n",
    "        - \\# of resultants is the number of samples up-the-ramp that will be downlinked from the telescope\n",
    "    - As of the R2025.9 release, RIST no longer supports truncation of the MA tables, as it may result in undesirable effects on the data and observations (e.g. data volume for data downlink capabilities, and larger overheads due to telescope slew & settle). If you need to explore shorter exposure times than what is available in RIST, you can still use the Pandeia engine to explore the MA table truncation options, but caution is needed when considering the truncation.\n",
    "    - More information about the MA tables can be found on the [WFI MultiAccum Tables RDox](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/raug/astronomers-proposal-tool-apt/appendix/appendix-wfi-multiaccum-tables) page.\n",
    "- RIST uses the following abbreviations:\n",
    "    - IM: Imaging mode\n",
    "    - HLWAS: High Latitude Wide Area Survey\n",
    "    - HLTDS: High Latitude Time Domain Survey\n",
    "    - GBTDS: Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey\n",
    "- The computed SNR values can be visualized by hovering the cursor over the points in the plot.\n",
    "- Pandeia cannot calculate a SNR for saturated sources. In RIST, saturated points are set to zero and marked as triangles in the plot.\n",
    "- The x-axis shows the central wavelength of each Roman filter.\n",
    "- Once you are satisfied with the estimated SNRs, you should use the [Roman WFI ETC](https://roman.etc.stsci.edu/) to provide specific observing parameters for [Roman APT](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/raug). Documentation on the Roman WFI ETC can be found [here](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/simulation-tools-handbook-home/roman-wfi-exposure-time-calculator)."
