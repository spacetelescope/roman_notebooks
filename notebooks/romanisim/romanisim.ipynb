    "The purpose of this notebook is to show how to generate simulated Level 1 (L1; uncalibrated ramp cubes) and Level 2 (L2; calibrated rate images) Roman Wide Field Instrument (WFI) Advanced Scientific Data Format (ASDF) files with [Roman I-Sim](https://romanisim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (package name `romanisim`). Details about the Roman data levels can be found in the [Data Levels and Products](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/wfi-data-format/data-levels-and-products) article in the Roman Documentation System (RDox). Briefly, a L1 file contains a single uncalibrated ramp exposure in units of Data Numbers (DN).  L1 files are three-dimensional data cubes, one dimension for time and two dimensions for image coordinates, that are shaped as  arrays with (N resultants, 4096 image rows, 4096 image columns). A resultant is a sample up-the-ramp, and represents either a single read of the WFI detectors or multiple reads that have been combined. The L2 WFI data are calibrated images in instrumental units of DN / second.  They are two-dimensional arrays shaped as (4088 image rows, 4088 image columns)."

    "Previously in this tutorial, we wrote a function to run Roman I-Sim. In that function, we overrode all of the default parameters and set them to `None` to force Roman I-Sim to use calibration reference files from CRDS rather than the Roman I-Sim default scalar values. These default scalar values are intended to allow Roman I-Sim to in an offline mode when you may not have access to a CRDS cache or the CRDS server. However, the current version of the `inject_sources_into_l2()` function does not use CRDS reference files and must use the Roman I-Sim defaults. Because the injection needs the default parameter values, we need to restore them here. We accomplish that using Python's `importlib.reload()` function to reload the installed version of `romanisim.parameters` into memory:"

    "Now we run the source injection function `inject_sources_into_l2()` with our image (datamodel), the injection catalog (the variable `tab`), and we set `stpsf=True` to use STPSF-generated point spread functions (PSFs) for the simulation. Notice that we make a copy of the image using the `.copy()` method so that we inject the source into a copy of the image rather than the original. This lets us compare the original and the updated version after we inject the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, this will use the default Roman I-Sim parameter values for the injected source; however, perhaps the most critical parameter (the gain) can be modified in the function call. The gain is important in the simulation as the WFI zeropoints in the L2 metadata are intended to transform from DN/s to MJy/sr, and therefore contain a factor of the gain. If needed, the gain value used in the zeropoint can be found in the photom reference file. In the cell below, we will set the gain to the default value (2 e<sup>–</sup>/DN) to demonstrate the proper way to modify the value."
