# Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Notebooks

The `roman_notebooks` repository contains several workflows and tutorials that demonstrate how to plan observations for, simulate images from, and access and analyze data from the [Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope](https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov/) (Roman). Python Jupyter notebooks provide [**Tutorials**](markdown/tutorials.md) on specific topics (e.g., how to run the science data pipeline to calibrate an exposure), while [**Science Workflows**](markdown/workflows.md) combine multiple tutorials, along with documentation, to provide a guided end-to-end experience for a specific science use case.

The notebooks in this repository are designed for the [Roman Research Nexus](https://roman.science.stsci.edu), a cloud-based science platform specifically designed for Roman users. With a [MyST](https://proper.stsci.edu/proper/authentication/auth) account, users will be able to access the Nexus and learn how to work with Roman data in the cloud. The Nexus is currently under development and has limited user access, with public access planned for late 2025.

## Repository Organization

Notebook tutorials are organized under the `content/notebooks/` directory. Each notebook is contained within a folder along with a `requirements.txt` file and any other supporting files required to run the notebook.

Markdown documentation files are contained within the `markdown/` folder.

## Local Installation

The notebooks in this repository are designed to work on the Roman Research Nexus for the best user experience. Due to the size of Roman data, local use is not recommended for most users. However, we provide instructions for local installation below. For detailed instructions refer to the [**Working Localy**](markdown/local-run.md) instructions.
