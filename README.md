# Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Notebooks

The `roman_notebooks` repository contains several workflows and tutorials that demonstrate how to simulate images from, access, and analyze data from the [Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope](https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov/)
 (Roman), as well as how to plan observations. Python Jupyter notebooks provide [**Tutorials**](markdown/tutorials.md)
 on specific topics (e.g., how to run the science data pipeline to calibrate an exposure), while [**Science Workflows**](markdown/workflows.md) ombine multiple tutorials, along with documentation, to provide a guided, end-to-end experience for a specific science use case.

The notebooks in this repository are designed for use with the [Roman Research Nexus](https://roman.science.stsci.edu), a cloud-based science platform developed for Roman users. With a [MyST](https://proper.stsci.edu/proper/authentication/auth)
 account, users can access the Nexus and learn how to work with Roman data directly in the cloud. The Nexus is now entering an **Early Access phase**, during which users can explore core functionality while the platform continues to be actively developed and expanded.

## Repository Organization

Notebook tutorials are organized under the `content/notebooks/` directory. Each notebook is contained within a folder along with a `requirements.txt` file and any other supporting files required to run the notebook.

Markdown documentation files are contained within the `markdown/` folder.

## Local Installation

The notebooks in this repository are designed to work on the Roman Research Nexus for the best user experience. Due to the size of Roman data, local use is not recommended for most users. However, we provide instructions for local installation below. For detailed instructions refer to the [**Working Localy**](markdown/local-run.md) instructions.
