    "# Introduction\n",
    "This notebook explains how to perform **forced aperture photometry** (also known as *forced photometry* or *aperture photometry*) on Roman WFI images. Aperture photometry is useful for measuring the integrated fluxes for a set of specified source positions and aperture sizes. This technique is often valuable for extracting fluxes of known sources when it is impractical to fit for their positions and light distributions, or when simplicity and speed are high priorities. For example, aperture photometry can be used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faint sources.** If a source is too faint, then it can be difficult to fit for the source centroid, light profile, and flux.\n",
    "- **Sources detected at other wavelengths.** If a source is detected in a given bandpass, and the source size is expected to be the same across wavelengths, then it can be useful to define one aperture and measure the source fluxes across multiple filters.\n",
    "- **Time-series evolution of sources.** If a source brightness is decreasing over time, then we can use earlier observations obtained when the source was bright to specify an aperture and extract the flux in a time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we cover a simple example using the `photutils` package to extract fluxes from a catalog of known sources (stars and galaxies)."
