    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook explains how to perform **forced aperture photometry** (also known as *forced photometry* or *aperture photometry*) on Roman WFI images. Aperture photometry is useful for measuring the integrated fluxes for a set of specified source positions and aperture sizes. This technique is often valuable for extracting fluxes of known sources when it is impractical to fit for their positions and light distributions, or when simplicity and speed are high priorities. For example, aperture photometry can be used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faint sources.** If a source is too faint, then it can be difficult to fit for the source centroid, light profile, and flux.\n",
    "- **Sources detected at other wavelengths.** If a source is detected in a given bandpass, and the source size is expected to be the same across wavelengths, then it can be useful to define one aperture and measure the source fluxes across multiple filters.\n",
    "- **Time-series evolution of sources.** If a source brightness is decreasing over time, then we can use earlier observations obtained when the source was bright to specify an aperture and extract the flux in a time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we cover a simple example using the `photutils` package to extract fluxes from a catalog of known sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the WFI calibration is currently measured from ground test data, and changes are expected after launch. "

A reference file, called the Pixel Area Map (PAM), provides the area per pixel of each WFI detector normalized to the nominal pixel area. The nominal pixel area is the pixel area at the tangent point about which the distortion polynomial is defined.\n",

    "First, we can use the `crds` Python package to request the best pixel area map reference file that matches our observation. In this case, CRDS needs to know the instrument name (WFI), detector name (WFI01), and the start time of the exposure. We can pull all of this information out of the metadata of the L2 file. Note that we need to specify the start time as a string, so we use `meta.exposure.start_time.isot` to convert the `astropy.time.Time` object in the metadata to an ISOT string (i.e., it has the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSS). We set the argument `ignore_cache=True` below to force CRDS to update the files in our local cache. If this cell is re-run, we can set `ignore_cache=False` as we are confident we have pulled the latest information from the CRDS server. We also specify that the observatory is \"roman\" and that we want the \"area\" reference file type:"

    "Now we can apply the aperture correction to our flux, and then convert the flux in Jy to maggies and AB magnitudes. For any source with a flux in maggies less than 0, we will assign a value of NaN for the AB magnitude. Recall that maggies are defined such that 1 maggie is equal to the reference flux for the AB magnitude system, which is 3,631 Jy. Thus, to convert our measurements from Jankys to maggies, we divide our fluxes by 3,631 Jy. We will also mask out any sources that have a flux of less than or equal to zero as those will not convert to magnitudes. Such sources exist where the background flux was statistically higher than the measured source flux."

    "Our measurements of stars in the image agree well with the input catalog fluxes at the level of approximately 0.9%. There could be several reasons why we see a small offset between the input and output magnitudes. First, we use a single value of the gain for our zeropoint, but we could do better and use a gain per pixel to convert the image from DN/s to photo-electrons per second and apply the zeropoint (with the gain removed). This would likely decrease the scatter in the plot. Secondly, we used a single aperture correction for the whole image based on the model of a star with an average SED and located at the center of the detector. A more detailed handling of the aperture correction may also decrease the scatter, and may also help bring the measurements into better alignment with the input catalog. Finally, a more careful treatment of other systematics (e.g., interpixel capacitance) may yield even better results.\n",

    "A similar exercise in photometry can be repeated for the galaxies in the input catalog, but care should be taken when selecting apertures for galaxies as fixed aperture sizes will correspond to different physical sizes at the distances of galaxies. Other choices for galaxy apertures include, e.g., Kron apertures or isophotal apertures."
