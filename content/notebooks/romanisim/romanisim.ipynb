    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to show how to generate simulated Level 1 (L1; uncalibrated ramp cubes) and Level 2 (L2; calibrated rate images) Roman Wide Field Instrument (WFI) Advanced Scientific Data Format (ASDF) files with Roman I-Sim (package name `romanisim`). Details about the Roman data levels can be found in the [Data Levels and Products](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/wfi-data-format/data-levels-and-products) article in the Roman Documentation System (RDox). Briefly, a L1 file contains a single uncalibrated ramp exposure in units of Data Numbers (DN).  L1 files are three-dimensional data cubes, one dimension for time and two dimensions for image coordinates, that are shaped as  arrays with (N resultants, 4096 image rows, 4096 image columns). A resultant is a sample up-the-ramp, and represents either a single read of the WFI detectors or multiple reads that have been combined. The L2 WFI data are calibrated images in instrumental units of DN / second.  They are two-dimensional arrays shaped as (4088 image rows, 4088 image columns)."

Note that the dither offsets are represented in the ideal X and Y directions (this means that +X is to the right and +Y is up when the WFI is in the U-shaped orientation with WFI07 and WFI16 in the upper-right and upper-left corners, respectively). The offsets are in units of arcseconds, and each offset represents the offset from the previous position. So, the zeroth position starts with offsets of 0.00 in both X and Y, and the first position is relative to the zeroth one, second position is relative to first, etc. Here is the pattern:\n",
