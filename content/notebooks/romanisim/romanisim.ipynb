    "The purpose of this notebook is to show how to generate simulated Level 1 (L1; uncalibrated ramp cubes) and Level 2 (L2; calibrated rate images) Roman Wide Field Instrument (WFI) Advanced Scientific Data Format (ASDF) files with [Roman I-Sim](https://romanisim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (package name `romanisim`). Details about the Roman data levels can be found in the [Data Levels and Products](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/wfi-data-format/data-levels-and-products) article in the Roman Documentation System (RDox). Briefly, a L1 file contains a single uncalibrated ramp exposure in units of Data Numbers (DN).  L1 files are three-dimensional data cubes, one dimension for time and two dimensions for image coordinates, that are shaped as  arrays with (N resultants, 4096 image rows, 4096 image columns). A resultant is a sample up-the-ramp, and represents either a single read of the WFI detectors or multiple reads that have been combined. The L2 WFI data are calibrated images in instrumental units of DN / second.  They are two-dimensional arrays shaped as (4088 image rows, 4088 image columns)."
