    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this notebook is to illustrate how to open and handle Roman Wide Field Instrument (WFI) data. WFI data are stored in [Advanced Scientific Data Format (ASDF)](https://asdf-standard.readthedocs.io/) files, which combine human-readable hierarchical metadata structure with binary array data. ASDF files are self-validating using pre-defined schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are tools to interact with ASDF files in Python, Julia, C/C++, and IDL. In this example we focus on the Python interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roman ASDF files can be opened and manipulated using two main approaches: 1. Using the `roman_datamodels` library, and 2. using the `asdf` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches should allow accessing the full data. Using `roman_datamodels` has as an advantage that the different data blocks are loaded as `stnode`-based objects, and gives us access to their methods. The `asdf` library, on the other hand, loads the data blocks as they were serialized in disk, which loses some of the `roman_datamodels` capabilities, but can allow more flexibility. We illustrate the two approaches in this notebook, and start showcasing loading via `roman_datamodels`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional information about ASDF in the context of Roman can be found in RDox: https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/wfi-data-format.\n",

    "**Note**: This notebook assumes familiarity with Python, Python dictionaries, and Jupyter notebooks, as well as some basic familiarity with `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `astropy`. "
