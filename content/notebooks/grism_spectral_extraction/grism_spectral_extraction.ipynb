Briefly, these simulations cover an area of 4 sq. deg., across a redshift range of $0<z<3$.

    "\n",
    "The simplest and most straightforward way to extract a 1-D spectrum from our 2-D cutout is to use the \"Box extraction\" method, by defining a window around the trace and summing up the flux along the spatial dimension. The dimension of the box window has a significant impact on the extracted spectrum -- it needs to be large enough to capture all the flux from the source, but not too large to include excessive amounts of noise which would degrade the quality of the 1-D spectrum. As an initial approach, we can define the size of the extraction box based on the size of the source measured from the direct image. We'll use the semi-major axis length from the catalog, scaled by a scalar factor, to explore how the window size affects the extracted 1-D spectrum."
