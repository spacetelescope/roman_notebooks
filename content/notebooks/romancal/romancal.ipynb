    "## Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to calibrate Level 1 (L1) data with the Roman WFI science calibration pipeline RomanCal (Python package name `romancal`) to produce Level 2 (L2) data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Details about the roman data levels can be found [here](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/wfi-data-format/data-levels-and-products). Broadly speaking Level 1 is three-dimensional data cube (one dimension for time and two dimensions for image coordinates) that represents a single uncalibrated ramp exposure in units of Data Numbers (DN).  More specifically, it is shaped as an array with shape (N resultants, 4096 image rows, 4096 image columns). The Level 2 WFI data are calibrated rate images in instrumental units of DN / second. "
