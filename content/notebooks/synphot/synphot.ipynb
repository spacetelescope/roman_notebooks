Note that we will use terms such as transmission and throughput interchangeably throughout the tutorial, but what we mean is the unitless measurement efficiency as a function of wavelength (or frequency) for the detection of photons at the end of the optics chain between the Roman primary mirror and the WFI detectors including all components in between (e.g., secondary mirror, optical elements, etc.)."
