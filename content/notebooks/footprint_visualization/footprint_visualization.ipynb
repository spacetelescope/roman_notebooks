For more information about these concepts we encourage the user follow the Roman documentation ([RDox](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu)).

The `read_pointings_file` function reads a pointings file as produced by APT and returns two `pandas.DataFrame` objects, that below we will name `obs_all`, and `reg_all`. The first DataFrame, `obs_all` in our case, encodes the observing strategy of a single mosaic segment (see RDox for more information: https://roman-docs.stsci.edu) on each survey step. The second one, `reg_all` in our case, contains the reference pointing positions (`ra_ref, dec_ref, PA`) of the `WFI_CEN` aperture for each segment in all of the region targets defined in the APT program that was used to create the `.pointing` file.\n",

So we need to go the the APT GUI, open the original program, and see which Survey Step corresponds to which target / filter combination.
