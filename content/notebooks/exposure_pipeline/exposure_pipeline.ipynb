    "The purpose of this notebook is to calibrate Level 1 (L1) data with the Roman WFI science calibration pipeline RomanCal (Python package name `romancal`) to produce Level 2 (L2) exposure level data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Details about the Roman data levels can be found [here](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/wfi-data-format/data-levels-and-products). A Level 1 file contains a single uncalibrated ramp exposure in units of Data Numbers (DN).  Level 1 files are three-dimensional data cubes, one dimension for time and two dimensions for image coordinates, that are shaped as  arrays with (N resultants, 4096 image rows, 4096 image columns). The Level 2 WFI data are calibrated images in instrumental units of DN / second.  They are two-dimensional arrays shaped as (4088 image rows, 4088 image columns)."
