    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook is designed to provide examples for how to access data from the science platform. In particular, it demonstrates how to stream data from the cloud directly into memory, circumventing the need to download the data locally and use excess storage. This method of accessing the data on the cloud is *HIGHLY* recommended, however we understand that some use-cases will require the data to be downloaded locally so we show an example of how to do that at the end of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here-in we examine how to download data from two types of sources:\n",
    "- the STScI MAST server which hosts data for in-flight telescopes including Hubble, TESS, and JWST\n",
    "- simulated Roman Space Telescope data hosted in storage containers on the AWS cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining terms\n",
    "- Cloud computing: the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer\n",
    "- AWS: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the cloud computing landscape that is provided by Amazon\n",
    "- URI: a Universal Resource Identifier (URI) is a sequence of characters that identify a name or a unique resource on the Internet. Website URLs are a subclass of URIs.\n",
    "- AWS S3: Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a very scalable and inexpensive object storage service on the AWS cloud platform. The storage containers are referred to as \"buckets\" so we will often refer to these storage devices as \"S3 buckets\" or \"S3 servers\"."

    "\n",
    "### Enabling Cloud Access\n",
    "The most important step for accessing data from the cloud is to enable *astroquery* to retreive URIs and other relevant cloud information. Even if we are working locally and plan to download the data files (not recommended for Roman data), we need to use this command to copy the file locations."

    "Now we are ready to begin our query. This example is rather simple, but is quick and easy to reproduce. We will be querying JWST NIRCAM data of M83 in this example. In our query, we specify that we want to look at JWST data using the F444W filter and NIRCAM. We also specify the proposal id to easily get the data of interest. Once we get the desired observations, we gather the list of products that go into the obervations. We then filter the products to gather all the rate image data products which still leaves us with 144 filtered products. To reduce the number of URIs we filter through, we choose a single observation to continue with in this notebook."
