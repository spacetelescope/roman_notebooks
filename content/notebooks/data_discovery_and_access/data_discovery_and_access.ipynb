    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook is designed to provide examples of accessing data from the science platform. Due to the survey nature of the Roman Space Telescope, it will produce large data volumes of data that will need to be easily and quickly accessed to perform scientific tasks like creating catalogs, difference imaging, generating light curves, etc. Downloading all the required data would burden most users by requiring excessive data storage solutions (likely >10TB).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to stream data from the cloud directly into memory, bypassing the need to download the data locally and use excess storage. This method of cloud-based data access is *HIGHLY* recommended. However, we understand that some use-cases will require downloading the data locally, so we also provide an example of how to do this at the end of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "During operations, each Roman data file will be given a Unique Resource Identifier (URI), an analog to an online filepath that is similar to a URL, which points to where the data is hosted on the AWS cloud. Users will retrieve these URIs from one of several sources including MAST (see [Accessing WFI Data](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/accessing-wfi-data) for more information) and will be able to use the URI to access the desired data from the cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here-in we examine how to download data from two types of sources:\n",
    "- The STScI MAST server which hosts data for in-flight telescopes including Hubble, TESS, and JWST and will host Roman data in the future\n",
    "- Simulated Roman Space Telescope data hosted in storage containers on the AWS cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining terms\n",
    "- *Cloud computing*: the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than using a local server or a personal computer.\n",
    "- *AWS*: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.\n",
    "- *URI*: a Universal Resource Identifier (URI) is a sequence of characters that identifies a name or a unique resource on the Internet. URLs for websites are a subclass of URIs.\n",
    "- *AWS S3*: Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a scalable and cost-effective object storage service on the AWS cloud platform. Storage containers within S3 are knwon as \"buckets,\" so we often refer to these storage devices as \"S3 buckets\" or \"S3 servers\"."
