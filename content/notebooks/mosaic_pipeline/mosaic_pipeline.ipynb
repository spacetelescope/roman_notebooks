    "## Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to combine multiple Level 2 (L2; calibrated rate image) data products into a Level 3 (L3; distortion-corrected, co-added image) product. Details about the Roman data levels can be found [here](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/wfi-data-format/data-levels-and-products). The pipeline for combinging images is called the Mosaic Pipeline, and it consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Flux step:** Transform pixels from instrumental units of data numbers per second (DN/s) in the L2 products into physical surface brightness units of megaJanskys per steradian (MJy/sr).\n",
    "2. **Skymatch step:** Determine scaling factors necessary to match the flux levels in the overlapping sections of the input images. The images will be scaled by these factors later in the combination process.\n",
    "3. **Outlier detection step:** Examine the input images to detect and flag outliers in the pixel values for a given sky position.\n",
    "4. **Resample step:** Use the drizzle algorithm to combine the input data products. Reject outliers and other undesirable pixels based on data quality flags and oversample the pixels if indicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** L3 data products in the Roman Archive will be tessellated on the sky such that individual L3 files (\"sky cells\") will be small with some overlap between adjacent cells. More information on the tessellation will be available in the near future. In this tutorial, we will not use the tessellation at this time and the tutorial will be updated in the future to show how to make tessellated and non-tessellated products.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** An additional step, the Source Catalog step, exists at the end of the Mosaic Pipeline to create Level 4 (L4; catalogs and other high-level products) outputs. In this tutorial, we have disabled the SourceCatalog step. While development continues on the Roman pipeline, enabling the SourceCatalog step may result in an error."

If you have already worked through the tutorials \"Simulating WFI Imaging Data with Roman I-Sim\" and \"Calibrating WFI Exposures with RomanCal,\" then you may already have these files saved locally. If not, then these files are also stored in the science platform S3 bucket. For more information on how to access these data, see the Data Discovery and Access tutorial.\n",

As this has not been optimized for oversampling, and only for gap-filling between detectors, we will create a mosaicked L3 product that uses the native pixel scale."

At this time, we will not delve into these optional parameters. The input files we have simulated are for a simple gap-filling dither pattern rather than sub-pixel dithering to optimize the point spread function (PSF); thus, we use the default native sampling of the WFI detectors. In the future, we may explore adding more information for optimizing the Mosaic Pipeline output."
