    "# Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to combine multiple Level 2 (L2; calibrated rate image) data products into a Level 3 (L3; distortion-corrected, co-added image) product. Details about the Roman data levels can be found [here](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/wfi-data-format/data-levels-and-products). The pipeline for combining images is called the Mosaic Pipeline. Please review the [RDox pages](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/roman-stsci-data-pipelines/mosaic-level-pipeline) for details. It consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Flux step:** Transform instrumental units of data numbers per second (DN/s) into physical surface brightness units of megaJanskys per steradian (MJy/sr).\n",
    "2. **Skymatch step:** Determine scaling factors necessary to match the flux levels in the overlapping sections of the input images. The images will be scaled by these factors later during the combination process.\n",
    "3. **Outlier detection step:** Examine the input images to detect and flag outliers in the pixel values for a given sky position.\n",
    "4. **Resample step:** Use the drizzle algorithm to combine the input data products. Reject outliers and other undesirable pixels based on data quality flags and oversample the pixels if indicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** L3 data products in the Roman Archive will be tessellated on the sky such that individual L3 files (\"sky cells\") will be small with some overlap between adjacent cells. More information is available on the [RDox pages on sky tessellation](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/wfi-data-format/skymap-tessellation). In this tutorial, we will not utilize tessellation. The tutorial will be updated in the future to demonstrate the creation of both tessellated and non-tessellated products.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** An additional step, the source catalog step, is included at the end of the Mosaic Pipeline to create Level 4 (L4; catalogs and other high-level products) products. In this tutorial, the source catalog step has been disabled. As development on the Roman pipeline is ongoing, enabling the source catalog step may currently result in an error."

    "# Tutorial Data\n",
    "In this tutorial, we use L2 WFI data files produced by RomanCal processing of L1 simulated files created with Roman I-Sim. If you have already worked through the tutorials [Simulating WFI Imaging Data with Roman I-Sim](../romanisim/romanisim.ipynb) and [Calibrating WFI Exposures with RomanCal](../exposure_pipeline/exposure_pipeline.ipynb), you may already have these files saved locally. If not, these files are also available in the Nexus S3 bucket. For more information on how to access these data, see the [Data Discovery and Access](../data_discovery_and_access/data_discovery_and_access.ipynb) tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The L2 products used in this tutorial represent data from one WFI detector (WFI11) across four different pointings, each with small dithers. These dithers are optimized for gap-filling between detectors rather than for oversampling. Therefore, in this tutorial we will generate a mosaicked L3 product using the native pixel scale."

    "\n",
    "Association table files (often abbreviated \"association files\" or \"ASN files\") are JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formatted files containing a list of the input products to be processed together, and the output products to be created. In the Mosaic Pipeline, association files specifically enumerate the input L2 products that are used to create a single L3 product. For more information, please visit the [RDox pages on association files](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/wfi-data-format/data-levels-and-products/associations).\n",

    "The association generator function `asn_from_list()` can be used to create a properly formatted JSON file for use with the Mosaic Pipeline. The code takes as input a list of L2 products and the name of the L3 output product.\n",

    "If you have not completed the previous tutorial [Calibrating WFI Exposures with RomanCal](../exposure_pipeline/exposure_pipeline.ipynb), then you can download the data products from the Nexus S3 bucket. The code cell below will check if you have the files saved on disk and, if not, it will retrieve them from the S3 bucket."
