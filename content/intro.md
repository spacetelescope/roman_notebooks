# Welcome to the Roman Research Nexus – Early Access

The Roman Research Nexus (RRN) is the cloud-based platform where users will access and analyze Roman mission data during operations. It brings Roman software, analysis tools, compute resources, and data products together in a single workspace that runs directly in your browser through JupyterLab.

During Early Access, the Nexus provides simulated Roman datasets and tools that allow users to explore and simulate data, test workflows, and become familiar with the cloud environment that will support Roman science once operational data become available.

## Why Use the Nexus
The Nexus places Roman data, software, and computing resources in a shared cloud environment, removing the need for local installations or large data downloads. Because Roman’s data volume will reach tens of petabytes (∼30 PB), downloading data to individual machines will not be practical; instead, the Nexus brings the analysis tools to the data. Users can work in a stable, curated setting that reflects how Roman data will ultimately be accessed during operations. This approach makes it easier to build and test workflows, run analyses consistently across sessions and server configurations, and scale computational resources to the mission’s data volume.


## Who the Nexus Is For
The Nexus is intended for anyone working with—or preparing to work with—Roman data and tools. It supports a wide range of users, from researchers involved in Roman science to students and educators learning about the mission. The platform is designed to support both newcomers and experienced users as they engage with data and tools relevant to Roman science.


## What You Can Do in the Nexus
The Nexus brings together the core components needed for Roman science:

- **Configurable compute options**, from small exploratory servers to larger CPU- or memory-optimized setups
- **Roman software and tools** in an STScI-curated environment
- [**Notebook tutorials**](../markdown/tutorials.md) introducing specific tools or concepts
- [**Science workflows**](../markdown/workflows.md) illustrating representative end-to-end use cases
- [**Simulated datasets**](../markdown/simulated-data.md) for exploring data structures and testing workflows
- [**Team collaboration**](../markdown/teams.md), with shared team directories and Real-Time Collaboration (RTC) servers


## Storage and Session Behavior
Your home directory and any team directories you belong to persist across sessions and remain available even when servers are stopped. Software installed inside a running session does not persist unless saved in a custom environment located in persistent storage. More information is available on the [Installing extra software](../markdown/software.md) page.  


## Current Content and Limitations
- During Early Access, the platform includes simulated Wide Field Instrument (WFI) datasets; additional datasets and capabilities will be added over time as Roman approaches operations.
- Tutorials and workflows focus on representative science use cases and will expand as tools and data products mature.


## More Information
Additional background and reference materials are available through:
